# Vision

## April-tags
Currently Big D assigned.
Will be used to find locations for the cube nodes. Will detect, turn to be parallel/perpendicular to the tag, and then drive across to drop the cubes in the nodes

## Retro-reflective tape
Currently me, heh.
Will be used like the April-tags to find the location of the cone nodes.

## Class structure maybe?
