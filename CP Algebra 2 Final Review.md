12. *a*    Tricks you up, just graphing. Simple.
13. d
14. c
15. *c*   Remember slope formula, and point slope form.
16. *c*   If you flip anything there has to be a - sign
17. b  !-> Remember that a stretch is just multiplication
18. d  !-> You will get bored. Remember parabolas, vertex (h,k) Inside will be opposite.
19. *c*  !-> > means shading above, < means below
