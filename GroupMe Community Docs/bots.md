# Bots

All endpoints are relative to https://api.groupme.com/v3/ and must include the token of the user making the call - so, for example, if an endpoint is `GET /groups`, the request you make should be using the URL `https://api.groupme.com/v3/groups?token=aSDFghJkl`, where `aSDFghJkl` is replaced with the user's token.

URLs which include a variable, such as `GET /groups/:id`, have their variables marked with a colon. So a request to that endpoint would look like `https://api.groupme.com/v3/groups/1234567?token=aSDFghJkl`, where `1234567` is replaced with the group's ID, and `aSDFghJkl` is replaced with the user's token.

Finally, all responses are wrapped in a response envelope of the following form:

```
{
	"response": {
		"id": "12345",
		"name": "Family"
		...
	},
	"meta": {
		"code": 200,
		"errors": []
	}
}
```

If the request succeeds, `meta.errors` will be null, and if the request fails, `response` will be null.

# Important notes

The bots described in this page are what GroupMe describes as "bots". These bots have serious limitations, including but not limited to:

1. They cannot like messages

2. They cannot be in more than one group

3. They cannot be DM'd (Though they can be attached to their creator's DMs)

4. They cannot read previous messages or any other data in a group - they only have access to a message once, when it's sent to it via the callback URL.

These limitations can produce incredibly powerful and interesting bots, and if your application can deal with these limitations, it's generally safer to use this style of bot. However, if your application needs to be able to do more than that, it may be a better idea to simply create a new user with a different email and phone number, and automate that account by connecting it to GroupMe's push service, and using the rest of the API to do things like create groups, send messages, etc. An example of this (Perhaps not a good example, but an example nonetheless) is [my primary bot, Lowes](https://github.com/2CATteam/gmuserbot). If you have a better, better-documented example, feel free to submit a pull request changing this section.

Lastly, while GroupMe does offer API endpoints for creating, destroying, and indexing bots, and these are documented below, they also offer [a web form for managing them](https://dev.groupme.com/bots/), so you should probably use that to do that unless you need to automate these tasks. They also have an official [bot tutorial](https://dev.groupme.com/tutorials/bots) and a [bot sample project](https://github.com/groupme/bot-tutorial-nodejs), so if you're just beginning to play around with bots and APIs, you may find those useful.
