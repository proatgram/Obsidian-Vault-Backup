# Calendar Events

All endpoints are relative to https://api.groupme.com/v3/ and must include the token of the user making the call - so, for example, if an endpoint is `GET /groups`, the request you make should be using the URL `https://api.groupme.com/v3/groups?token=aSDFghJkl`, where `aSDFghJkl` is replaced with the user's token.

URLs which include a variable, such as `GET /groups/:id`, have their variables marked with a colon. So a request to that endpoint would look like `https://api.groupme.com/v3/groups/1234567?token=aSDFghJkl`, where `1234567` is replaced with the group's ID, and `aSDFghJkl` is replaced with the user's token.

Finally, all responses are wrapped in a response envelope of the following form:

```
{
	"response": {
		"id": "12345",
		"name": "Family"
		...
	},
	"meta": {
		"code": 200,
		"errors": []
	}
}
```

If the request succeeds, `meta.errors` will be null, and if the request fails, `response` will be null.

## Index events

List all the upcoming events for the group

**Request**

`GET /conversations/:group_id/events/list?end_at=2021-07-12T02:52:50Z&limit=20`

**Parameters**

* *end_at* (required)

	string - an ISO 8601-formatted string which represents the date before which no events will be listed. IMO it makes more sense to call this "start_at", but that's none of my business.

* *limit* (required)

	integer - the number of results to pull. GroupMe's default is 20, not sure what the limit is.

**Responses**

```

  "location": {
	"address": "Kalkofnsvegur 2 101, 101 Reykjavík, Iceland",
	"name": "Heaven?",
	"lat": "64.148430",
	"lng": "-21.9355508"
  },
  "reminders": [0, 300]
}
```

**Parameters**

* *name* (required)

	string - The name of the event.

* *start_at* (required)

	string - A datetime in ISO 8601 format. Represents the date and time that the event starts.

* *end_at* (required)

	string - A datetime in ISO 8601 format. Represents the date and time that the event ends.
	
* *timezone* (required)

	string - An indication of what timezone the event takes place in. Seems to be based on the [TZ Database](https://www.iana.org/time-zones) names.

* *description*

	string - The text you want to use to describe the event.

* *is_all_day*

	boolean - If true, will not specify a time for clients.
	
* *image_url*

	string - An image URL which will be attached to the event if provided

* *location*

	object - Can contain address, name (required), lat, and lng fields. Address and name are both strings, while lat and lng must be numbers expressed as strings (as shown in the example) which represent the latitude and longitude, respectively, of the location.
	
* *reminders*

	array - An array of integers, which represent automatic reminders from GroupMe. The number is the number of seconds between the reminder and the start of the event - for example, if one of the numbers is 300, that represents sending a reminder 5 minutes before the event starts. Only two reminders are permitted, and only certain values are permitted: 0, 300, 900, 1800, 3600, 7200, 86400, 172800, and 604800.

## Edit/Update an event

Edit or update an event. In order to do this, you must be the original creator of the event. Note that this is very similar to the Create request. You only need to provide whatever parameters you wish to change about the original event, but start_at, end_at, timezone, and is_all_day MUST be provided together if any of them are included!
