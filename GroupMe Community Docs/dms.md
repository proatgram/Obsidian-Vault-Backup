# Direct Messages

All endpoints are relative to https://api.groupme.com/v3/ and must include the token of the user making the call - so, for example, if an endpoint is `GET /groups`, the request you make should be using the URL `https://api.groupme.com/v3/groups?token=aSDFghJkl`, where `aSDFghJkl` is replaced with the user's token.

URLs which include a variable, such as `GET /groups/:id`, have their variables marked with a colon. So a request to that endpoint would look like `https://api.groupme.com/v3/groups/1234567?token=aSDFghJkl`, where `1234567` is replaced with the group's ID, and `aSDFghJkl` is replaced with the user's token.

Finally, all responses are wrapped in a response envelope of the following form:

```
{
	"response": {
		"id": "12345",
		"name": "Family"
		...
	},
	"meta": {
		"code": 200,
		"errors": []
	}
}
```

If the request succeeds, `meta.errors` will be null, and if the request fails, `response` will be null.

## Index Messages

Fetch direct messages between two users.

DMs are returned in groups of 20, ordered by created_at descending.

If no messages are found (e.g. when filtering with since_id) we return code 304.

Note that for historical reasons, likes are returned as an array of user ids in the favorited_by key.

**Request**

`GET /direct_messages`

**Parameters**

* *other_user_id* (required)

	string — The other participant in the conversation.
	
* *before_id*

	string — Returns messages created before the given message ID
	
* *since_id*

	string — Returns messages created after the given message ID

* *after_id*

	string - Returns messages created immediately after the given message ID

* *limit*

	integer - Number of messages returned. Default is 20. Max is 100.

## Send DM

Send a DM to another user

If you want to attach an image, you must first process it through the image service (More on that in the [attachments documentation](attachments.md)).

Attachments of type emoji rely on data from emoji PowerUps.

Clients use a placeholder character in the message text and specify a replacement charmap to substitute emoji characters

The character map is an array of arrays containing rune data ([[{pack_id,offset}],...]).

The placeholder should be a high-point/invisible UTF-8 character.

**Request**
```
POST /direct_messages
{
  "direct_message": {
    "source_guid": "GUID",
    "recipient_id": "20",
    "text": "Hello world ",
    "attachments": [
      {
        "type": "image",
        "url": "https://i.groupme.com/123456789"
      },
      {
        "type": "image",
        "url": "https://i.groupme.com/123456789"
      },
      {
        "type": "location",
        "lat": "40.738206",
        "lng": "-73.993285",
        "name": "GroupMe HQ"
      },
      {
        "type": "emoji",
        "placeholder": "",
        "charmap": [
          [
            1,
            42
          ],
          [
            2,
            34
          ]
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
**Parameters**
* *source_guid* (required)

	string - Client-side IDs for messages. This can be used by clients to set their own identifiers on messages, but the server also scans these for de-duplication. That is, if two messages are sent with the same source_guid within one minute of each other, the second message will fail with a 409 Conflict response. So it's important to set this to a unique value for each message.
	
* *recipient_id* (required)

	string - the GroupMe user ID of the recipient of this message.
	
* *text* (required)

	string - This can be omitted if at least one attachment is present. The maximum length is 1,000 characters.
	
* *attachments*

	array - A polymorphic list of attachments (locations, images, etc). You may have more than one of any type of attachment, provided clients can display it.
	
	For more information on types of attachments and how to send them, check out the [attachments documentation](attachments.md)
