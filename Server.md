# Reasons to have a domain
---
I would like something to do, I have seen some videos and some posts of peoples' setups which looked really awesome, I have been in need of a new hobby and this has peaked my interest. I began tinkering around with server stuff a while before I asked about the domain, but I was pretty limited on what I could do. A lot of the "basic" applications I hosted successfully were kinda useless without a way to share a custom URL. For example a PasteBin software



## Organization
Having a domain will allow me to organize the applications that I run and host on it in a pleasing way. For example, if I were to run GitLab, instead of having to specify the address `localhost:6789` or maybe even `170.10.0.4:6789` if I were to go through a VPN, then having a domain (then paired with a subdomain for the specific app) like `git.thetimbrick.dev` would make it much easier to remember. This will allow me to differentiate between different apps that I have running.
