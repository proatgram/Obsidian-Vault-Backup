# Apps I'm planning on tinkering with or running
---
All of these are subject to change, and *will probably* change due to me just experimenting with different things, trying them out, etc. This list is more or le
 - GitLab (and their respective CI/CD runners)
 - PasteBin software
 - Drag n Drop file share
 - EMail
 - Quite possibly a personal blog, maybe
 - Custom Matrix instance
 - Game servers (Interested in Modded Minecraft, but some mods, like IG Voice Chat require more ports than what playit.gg can offer)
 - Password Manager
 - Possibly some Software Development tools
 - URL Shortener


# Reasons to have a domain
---
I would like something to do, I have seen some videos and some posts of peoples' setups which looked really awesome, I have been in need of a new hobby and this has peaked my interest. I began tinkering around with server stuff a while before I asked about the domain, but I was pretty limited on what I could do. A lot of the "basic" applications I hosted successfully were kinda useless without a way to share a custom URL. For example a PasteBin software, used to share say error logs, coredumps, configurations, etc, would need a way to share whatever text you save on it, hence a need for a public domain that you can easily pass around. 

Another reason, is some apps are broken without it. To give some examples, I had a hard time getting GitLab to output a reasonable redirect URL for me to sign on and / or create an account, manage CI/CD runners, etc, as it would spit out a garbled URL. Another example, which doesn't even work to it's full potential without the domain, is some software called Forte, a self-hosted music platform which is decentralized and federated. Now, self hosting software to stream music, either from other federated servers or locally, would be almost completely useless without a way to actually access them when you actually want to, for example on a trip, while traveling, at school even when allowed to.

## Organization
Having a domain will allow me to organize the applications that I run and host on it in a pleasing way. For example, if I were to run GitLab, instead of having to specify the address `localhost:6789` or maybe even `170.10.0.4:6789` if I were to go through a VPN, then having a domain (then paired with a subdomain for the specific app) like `git.thetimbrick.dev` would make it much easier to remember. This will allow me to differentiate between different apps that I have running.
